# Go_Together_App

As part of the Go Together community-based ride-sharing project, I was responsible for developing the Trip Details Page of the mobile application using Flutter and Firebase. This feature allows users to create and manage trips by entering key details such as title, description, date, available seats, price, and vehicle type.I implemented data validation to ensure all required fields are correctly filled and integrated real-time synchronization with Firebase Firestore, allowing updates to appear instantly for all users.

The interface was designed with Material Design principles, focusing on simplicity and a smooth user experience. This page plays a key role in enabling reliable, accurate, and user-friendly trip creation within the Go Together platform.
